    <div class="mybox">
    <p> During our lecture on Dedekind Cuts, I found many of my classmates struggling,
        e.g. not understanding why we want to prove "a + b = b + a" in such a
        complicated way. This article is a Piazza post I made after the lecture
        to explain the big picture behind Dedekind Cuts (with some revisions).
        For the more technical details of Dedekind Cuts, see the last section of my
        MAT157Y1 notes.

    <h2>Testing Heading 2</h2>
    <p> I felt that many people were confused during today's lecture,
        so I thought I could share my understanding of Dedekind Cuts here.
    </p>
    <p> I think today's material is better understood by thinking analogously
        to vector spaces. If you recall, a vector space consists of a Domain,
        a Vector Addition operator, and a Scalar Multiplication operator.
        An example---we first define:
        <ul>
            <li>Domain: {(x,y) |x,y &isin; Q}
                i.e. the set of rational pairs</li>
            <li>Vector Addition: (x,y) + (a,b) = (x+a,y+b)</li>
            <li>Scalar Multiplication: c(x,y) = (cx,cy)</li>
        </ul>
        Then, we verify such a structure satisfies the axioms of vector spaces.
    </p>
    <p> We do something similar for fields. Just like we deployed the notion of Q
        and constructed the vector space Q^2, this time we want to deploy, still,
        the notion of Q, and construct an interesting ordered field, called R.
        I will explain the philosophical "why we do" in a moment, but for now
        just focus on the "what we do"---we first define the Domain,
        Addition, Multiplication, Order, etc. of R, as follows:
        (remember, the ultimate goal of this discussion is to construct R, which
        means at this point we should not beg the question and assume R already
        existed, and so the following definitions avoid deploying the notion of R)
        <ul>
            <li>Domain: &alpha; &sub; Q | a is a Dedekind Cut
                i.e. the set of Dedekind Cuts (a Dedekind Cut is a subset
                of Q that has specific properties)</li>
            <li>Addition: &alpha;+&beta; = x+y | x in a, y in b</li>
            <li>Multiplication: ...</li>
            <li>... etc. (as defined in class)</li>
        </ul>
        Then, we verify (or "discover," if you wish) that such a structure
        satisfies (P1)-(P13).
    </p>
    <p> After all of that, we simply define R:=R, with numbers in R just being
        shorthand notations for Dedekind Cuts in R. For instance, the (true)
        statement about R:<br>
        circled1 0 + 1 = 1<br>
        can be contracted to:<br>
        circled2 0 + 1 = 1<br>
        Or we can also say, when we write down statements about R,
        such as circled2, it is actually something like circled1 in disguise.
    </p>
    <p> The reason why we go through all of these cumbersome tasks and define R
        in such a complicated way is that, philosophically we want to make as few
        assumptions as possible, especially about what kinds of structures exist.
        Recall the natural numbers. (HAVE NOT FINISHED REVISING THE REST)
    </p>
    <p> the fact that there is actually a structure satisfying the Peano Axioms of
        Natural Number is not obvious at all. So the existence of N is really just
        an assumption---we presuppose the existence of N and then do arithmetics.
        We HAVE TO accept that presupposition, otherwise we cannot do any math.
    </p>
    <p> Now you might think, we also HAVE TO "assume" that there is a structure
        satisfying the Axioms of Reals (i.e. (P1)-(P13)),
        but the genius thing about Dedekind Cuts is that, we don't! As we have shown,
        by only assuming the existence of N, we can then so to speak
        "construct (no longer assuming)" the existence of structures like Z, Q,
        and (using Dedekind Cuts) R. In short, Dedekind Cuts allow us to not "assume"
        the existence of R, but "construct" it!
