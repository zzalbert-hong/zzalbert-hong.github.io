    <h1 style="display:none;">Blog</h1>
    <p> Below are articles I have written recently, including mathematical or philosophical
        expositions and discussions. Or see <a href="mathematics.html">here</a>
        for the complete list, organized by topics.
    </p>
    <p> I started this blog in Summer 2025, motivated by 3Blue1Brown's
        <i>Summer of Math Expositions (SoME)</i>. Hopefully&mdash;despite busy studying
        and working&mdash;I continue writing, and hopefully somebody finds them helpful.
        Feel free to shoot me an <a href="mailto:albert.hong@mail.utoronto.ca">email</a>
        if there is something you want me to write about, or even just to let me know
        how you feel about my articles. I do read all emails, though I might not
        have the time to respond.

    <!-- <p> <a href="/">Limits Part I (webpage; 2025.05.20)</a>:
        The most confusing topic that first year math students encounter is perhaps the
        Epsilon-Delta Definition for limits. For one, students struggle to understand the
        statement; for another, it is not clear why limits are defined like so.
        In this article, I explain and motivate the Definition from a special perspective.
    </p>
    <p> <a href="/">Limits Part II (PDF; 2025.05.20)</a>:
        Another confusing aspect about limits is the idea of "approaching but not touching."
        A lot of students ask: Are limits actually equal to some value or infinitely
        approaching but not equal? In this article, I explain how to understand and use the
        terminology "limit."
    </p>
    <p> <a href="/">Limits Part III (PDF; 2025.05.20)</a>:
        While we often associate limits with specific ideas, there are peculiar functions
        that challenge these inuitions. I have wrote this article to provide a few,
        and share my attitude towards those cases.
