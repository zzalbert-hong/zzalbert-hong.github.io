<p> <a href="/">Proofs And Axioms (webpage; 2025.05.20)</a>:
    The most confusing topic that first year math students encounter is perhaps the
    Epsilon-Delta Definition for limits. For one, students struggle to understand the
    statement; for another, it is not clear why limits are defined like so.
    In this article, I explain and motivate the Definition from a special perspective.

<p> <a href="/">Limits Part II (PDF; 2025.05.20)</a>:
    Another confusing aspect about limits is the idea of "approaching but not touching."
    A lot of students ask: Are limits actually equal to some value or infinitely
    approaching but not equal? In this article, I explain how to understand and use the
    terminology "limit."
</p>
<p> <a href="/">Limits Part III (PDF; 2025.05.20)</a>:
    While we often associate limits with specific ideas, there are peculiar functions
    that challenge these inuitions. I have wrote this article to provide a few,
    and share my attitude towards those cases.
