         <p>Albert is currently a first year student at UofT Engineering Science.
            He is planning to transfer to Specialist in Mathematics at UofT.
            He also plans to do PhD in Mathematics at some university on Mars.
            His ultimate goal is to become a math professor on Jupiter.

               <h1>1. Undergrad: UofT Math</h1>
               <p>Below you will find the notes to each course Albert took at UofT.
                  <br>Each file corresponds to a course and will contain the following sections:
                  <br>    (a) Overview of the math content and the course.
                  <br>    (b) List of definitions and theorems for each chapter.
                  <br>    (c) My explanations for some of the confusing concepts.
                  <br>    (d) Theorems proofs that I find amazingly elegant.
                  <br>    (e) Practice or exam problems that I find interesting.
                  <br>The intended audience of these notes are:
                  <br>    (a) People who are currently taking the course may use these notes
                  for exam review.
                  <br>    (b) People who are not enrolled in the course but are trying
                  to learn the math content. The notes provide recommendation for textbooks.
                  In addition, one may use the list of definitions and theorems as
                  a learning check-list.
                  <br>    (c) People planning to take the course can have a better picture of
                  the course by reading throught the overviews and browsing through the theorems.
