    <p> Below you will find essays I wrote to explain mathematical concepts or express
        my philosophical views, etc. I intended to make this like a blog.
        Hopefully I continue writing articles like these, and hopefully someone reads them.
    </p>

    <h2>Mathematics</h2>
    <p> <a href="/">Limits Part I (webpage; 2025.05.20)</a>:
        The most confusing topic that first year math students encounter is perhaps the
        Epsilon-Delta Definition for limits. For one, students struggle to understand the
        statement; for another, it is not clear why limits are defined like so.
        In this article, I explain and motivate the Definition from a special perspective.
    </p>
    <p> <a href="/">Limits Part II (PDF; 2025.05.20)</a>:
        Another confusing aspect about limits is the idea of "approaching but not touching."
        A lot of students ask: Are limits actually equal to some value or infinitely
        approaching but not equal? In this article, I explain how to understand and use the
        terminology "limit."
    </p>
    <p> <a href="/">Limits Part III (PDF; 2025.05.20)</a>:
        While we often associate limits with specific ideas, there are peculiar functions
        that challenge these inuitions. I have wrote this article to provide a few,
        and share my attitude towards those cases.

    <p> <a href="/">Invertible But Not Continuous (PDF; 2025.04.26)</a>:
        In MAT157, we proved that continuous bijections have continuous inverses. ...

    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p> <a href="/">"Aesthetics" Solely Subjective (webpage; 2025.04.27)</a>:
        In the philosophical discussion of aesthetics, there is one key question:
        Is aesthetics objective or subjective? For various reasons, many people today
        consider aesthetics "mostly subjective but containing some objective element."
        Yet in this article, I propose 3 arguments to defend my position that "aesthetics"
        is solely subjective.
