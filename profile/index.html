    <p> I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto. I began my studies
        in Engineering Science (2023), but later transferred to the Faculty of
        Arts and Science (2024), where I now major in Mathematics and minor in Philosophy
        and Economics. My academic interests lie especially in Real Analysis, Logic,
        and the Philosophy of Mathematics.
    </p>
    <p> The transfer was prompted by a deeper realization: I am most engaged not by
        building systems that simply work, but by understanding why they work.
        I am drawn to reasoning, structure, and explanation.
        I enjoy forming rigorous arguments for practical claims and value clear,
        coherent derivations over shortcuts. While I recognize the importance of practical
        outcomes, I believe they are best supported by careful, foundational thinking.
    </p>
    <p> Outside of academics, I enjoy watching films and reading and writing about
        mathematics and philosophy. I also play chess, sudoku, calligraphy, and badminton.

    <p class="mycap">My personal logo. I use a squirrel because both my
        high school (CKHS, Taipei) and university (UofT) are known to have many of them.
        (And I designed it as a <i>Tessellation Tile</i>. Can you see how?)
