<p> <a href="/">Proofs And Axioms (webpage; 2025.05.20)</a>:
    The most confusing topic that first year math students encounter is perhaps the
    Epsilon-Delta Definition for limits. For one, students struggle to understand the
    statement; for another, it is not clear why limits are defined like so.
    In this article, I explain and motivate the Definition from a special perspective.

<p> <a href="/">"Aesthetics" Solely Subjective (webpage; 2025.04.27)</a>:
    In the philosophical discussion of aesthetics, there is one key question:
    Is aesthetics objective or subjective? For various reasons, many people today
    consider aesthetics "mostly subjective but containing some objective element."
    Yet in this article, I propose 3 arguments to defend my position that "aesthetics"
    is solely subjective.
